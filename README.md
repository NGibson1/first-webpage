### Description

This is my first webpage I've ever completed. It's a static webpage that was a final projocet for my first coding class, Coding From Scratch, at Eastern Gateway Community College. This project was to demonstrate specific HTML skills:
- making a table 
- both unordered and ordered list
- nested list
- jump to links
- external links
- forms

It also required basic CSS styling which was all completed in the head section of the index document

I'm proud of this project as a "first" and will keep it just the way it is. I will always keep an orginal copy, but in the future I may make a more dynamic and personal version of it using Javascript, and possibly an API, with Chart.js to genrate and display Michael Jordan's Stats.
